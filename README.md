# JavaScript Loose Typing and Unexpected Arithmetic Results

This repository demonstrates how JavaScript's loose typing system can lead to unexpected results when performing arithmetic operations.  The `+` operator's behavior changes depending on the operand types, causing surprising outcomes when mixing numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is JavaScript's implicit type coercion. When adding different types, it may not perform arithmetic addition, but instead concatenate strings or produce unexpected numerical values.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.js`.
3. Observe the unexpected results of arithmetic operations due to type coercion.

## Solution

The solution is to explicitly check the types of operands before performing addition or to use type-safe methods when appropriate (e.g., using `parseInt()` to convert strings to numbers). Refer to the `bugSolution.js` for better handling.

## Lessons Learned

This example highlights the importance of understanding JavaScript's type system to avoid unexpected behavior. Explicit type checking and using type-safe functions can significantly reduce the risk of such errors.
